Bawendi is a distinguished Lester Wolfe Professor and Advisor for the Minor in Energy Studies, MIT Energy Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He is internationally acclaimed for his pioneering contributions to the synthesis and development of quantum dots, a class of nanoscale semiconducting crystals with remarkable optical and electronic properties. For his seminal work in this field, he was awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, alongside Louis E. Brus and Alexey Ekimov, for the discovery and synthesis of quantum dots.\nBawendi began his academic journey at Harvard University, earning an A.B. in 1982 and an A.M. in 1983. He went on to complete his Ph.D. in Chemistry at the University of Chicago in 1988, under the mentorship of Karl Freed and Takeshi Oka. His doctoral research encompassed both theoretical polymer physics and experimental studies on the H₃⁺ ion, which played a key role in unravelling the emission spectra of Jupiter.\nA transformative moment in Bawendi’s early career came during a summer research program at Bell Labs, where he was introduced to the emerging field of quantum dots by Louis E. Brus. Following his Ph.D., he returned to Bell Labs as a postdoctoral researcher, working closely with Brus before joining the faculty at MIT in 1990. He was promoted to full professor in 1996.\nIn 1993, Bawendi, along with his doctoral students David J. Norris and Christopher B. Murray, revolutionized nanomaterials research by developing the hot-injection synthesis method. This technique enabled the controlled, reproducible, and scalable production of quantum dots with uniform size and high optical quality. By precisely tuning their size, researchers could manipulate the optical and electronic characteristics of quantum dots, paving the way for their use in a wide array of applications including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells, lasers, photodetectors, chemical biology, biomedical imaging.\nOver the years, Professor Bawendi has emerged as one of the most cited chemists in the world and a leading authority in nanoscience. His contributions have not only advanced fundamental science but also fueled innovation across multiple industries.\nHis numerous accolades reflect his impact and influence:\n• Sloan Research Fellowship (1994)\n• Nobel Signature Award for Graduate Education in Chemistry by the American Chemical Society (1997)\n• Sackler Prize in Physical Chemistry of Advanced Materials (2001)\n• Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award (2006)\n• ACS Award in Colloid and Surface Chemistry (2010)\n• SEMI Award for North America (2011)\n• Clarivate Citation Laureate in Chemistry (2020)\n• Medal of Honor from Tunis University (2023)\nHe has also been elected to several prestigious academic societies:\n• Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2003)\n• Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2004)\n• Member of the National Academy of Sciences (2007)\nProf. Moungi Bawendi’s trailblazing research continues to inspire a generation of scientists and drive technological progress. His legacy is defined not only by scientific excellence but also by a profound impact on how nanomaterials are understood and applied in the modern world.\n "},{id:2,name:"Dr. Adam Lee",institution:"Griffith University",country:"Australia",image:"speak/1.jpg",description:"Dr. Adam Lee is a Professor of Sustainable Chemistry at Griffith University, Australia.

Subsequently, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at University of Pennsylvania, U.S.A. from 2006 to 2010 and then as a research associate at National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), Tsukuba, Japan from 2010 to 2012. He joined as a faculty at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mandi in April 2012 and is currently a full professor. His research group is mainly working in the field of Green Chemistry and Heterogeneous Catalysis for Energy and Environment Applications. He has successfully guided 12 Ph.D. and 26 M.Sc. students and is currently guiding 9 Ph.D. and 7 M.Sc. students, in addition to several short-term research interns. He has published more than 180 articles in well reputed international journals and is also a reviewer for several scientific journals. He has been bestowed with several awards, including DST INSPIRE faculty award, IIT Mandi foundation day award for excellence in teaching, MANA research fellowship, DoE postdoctoral fellowship, DFG doctoral fellowship, DAAD visiting scholar fellowship, etc. In addition to teaching and research, he has also served IIT Mandi in various administrative positions, such as first warden of the main hostel in permanent campus, founding coordinator of Advanced Materials Research Center (AMRC), Associate Dean Research and most recently as Dean of Sponsored Research, Industrial Consultancy, and International Relations (SRIC & IR), Director of IIT Mandi iHub and HCi foundation (a technology innovation hub) and Director of IIT Mandi Catalyst (a technology business incubator), besides being on several scientific and administrative committees at institute, national and international levels. Apart from academics, he likes reading books and is interested in linguistics."},{id:38,name:"Dr. Wim Deferme",institution:"Hasselt University",country:"Belgium",image:"speak/30.jpg",description:"\n      Wim Deferme obtained an engineering degree in Applied Physics at the Technical University of\nEindhoven in The Netherlands in 2003. He obtained a Ph.D. in Materials Physics at Hasselt\nUniversity in 2009 on the surface termination of synthetic diamond. In 2009, as a postdoc, he started\nresearch in the field of Printable Electronics. Since February 2014, he has been a Professor at\nHasselt University, heading a group of 1 post-doc, 8 Ph.D. students, two full-time researchers, and\nseveral bachelor and master students in the field of “Engineering of Functional Materials.” His\nresearch activities are focused on the printing of functional materials. Ink formulation towards\nfunctional inks, printing techniques such as inkjet printing, screen printing, and ultrasonic spray\ncoating, applications such as Organic Electronics, printed sensors for wound monitoring, and\nstretchable electronics are among his expertise!\nThe Functional Materials Engineering (FME) research group, headed by Prof. Wim Deferme, is\nfocused on the printing and coating of functional materials on a wide variety of substrates by\napplying techniques such as inkjet printing, screen printing, ultrasonic spray coating, spin coating,\nand blade coating. It is the aim of the FME group to optimize printing and coating techniques in\ncombination with the engineering of functional materials for applications such as Organic\nPhotovolta\xefcs, printed sensors, health care, and stretchable electronics applications. The group\nfocuses on the deposition of these devices on non-rigid and/or non-flat substrates such as paper,\ntextiles, and 3D structures."}];function
